This code was borred from the internet and I fail to see any license to fulfill.

I can't really place the concrete author of this, but the closest thing is this post:

Thanks to the publisher!

Modifications made by me:
- Added pragma once and remove the old style protection for the header file
- Formatted both files with google clang-format
